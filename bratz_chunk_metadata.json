    "text": "Yasmin is a warm, empathetic spirit. Often the voice of reason and kindness among the Bratz, she\u2019s known for her love of nature and humanitarian streak. Think of her as equal parts earthy and glamourous \u2014 she might be meditating with crystals one minute and interviewing a celebrity for the Bratz magazine the next. Yasmin is creative (she journals and writes songs/poetry), and her friends come to her when they need advice or a pep talk. She\u2019s got a chill vibe but don\u2019t mistake that for weakness \u2014 when it\u2019s time to stand up for what\u2019s right, Yasmin is quietly fierce. Always levelheaded and prepared, she\u2019s the girl with the plan (and a backup plan, and a backup to the backup). Personality Snapshot Empathetic, thoughtful, a bit dreamy yet surprisingly bold when needed. She\u2019s no pushover \u2014 her strength is just softer around the edges. Yasmin\u2019s Vibe \u201cBe kind, be true, be you\u2026and never forget to accessorize.\u201d Style Yasmin\u2019s fashion sense is boho-chic meets funky vintage. She adores floral prints, flowy fabrics, and a touch of animal print for drama. You\u2019ll catch her in earth tones mixed with pops of bold color. Platforms or wedges win over stilettos (gotta stay grounded!) and she\u2019s often rocking accessories like a flower in her hair, a wide belt, or globally-inspired jewelry. Makeup Her makeup is a bit softer compared to her girls \u2014 warm tones, shimmery eyes. Overall, her look says, \u201cfestival queen\u201d meets \u201curban gypsy.\u201d Likes Music (especially world music and anything she can dance or groove to) Creative Writing Journalism (she\u2019s the one spearheading the school newspaper or Bratz magazine with her articles) Animals (she has a pet \u2013 a cute lil\u2019 turtle in some stories) Trying new coffee shop concoctions with friends Thrift shopping is her jam \u2014 Yasmin loves finding unique pieces to spice up her wardrobe.

She\u2019s enthusiastic, outgoing, and sometimes a total goof (in the best way). Emotion is Cloe\u2019s middle name \u2014 she feels everything deeply and isn\u2019t afraid to show it. One minute she\u2019s over the moon, the next she\u2019s dramatically pouting because, like, her outfit didn\u2019t slay as hard as she thought. (Melodrama, thy name is Cloe.)",

She\u2019s basically the human equivalent of glitter \u2014 bright, fun, occasionally messy, but always bringing the sparkle. Personality Snapshot Energetic, fearless, a touch dramatic but endlessly devoted. Life to her is meant to be full of feeling. Cloe\u2019s Vibe \"If you\u2019re not living on the edge, you\u2019re taking up too much space \u2014 now pass the glitter!\u201d Style Cloe\u2019s fashion passion is glam with an edge. She loves sparkly fabrics and exotic animal prints. Think sequins, faux fur trim denim, leopard cow or zebra patterns, and anything that shines. She isn\u2019t afraid of a bold ensemble \u2014 mixing a sporty denim jacket with a frilly skirt and cowboy boots. Her outfit color palette is often icy blues, hot pinks, and animal print neutrals. She often adds a hint of athletic vibe (she might throw on a baseball cap or a jersey-inspired top) because she\u2019s pretty sporty too \u2014 did we mention she can rock a skateboard or soccer ball? Yeah, Angel\u2019s got skills. Makeup Cloe goes for cool tones (she famously has blue eyes, which she accentuates) and loves a glossy lip.

    "text": "Confident, outspoken, and driven \u2014 that\u2019s Sasha. She just goes for it and figures out the details later, which can sometimes get her in trouble! She\u2019s got a cuddly side that she shows to close friends (a source for her fluffy nickname), but Sasha is 100% a boss. Like actually. Sasha is a natural leader. If the Bratz are working on a project, Sasha\u2019s often steering the ship (and making sure everyone\u2019s on task, because she\u2019s low-key the perfectionist of the bunch). Her friends lovingly tease her for being a bit bossy at times, but they all know Sasha\u2019s the one who\u2019ll go to war for them without question. Often portrayed as the music maven of the group, Sasha loves performing. Whether DJing or dancing, she\u2019s got rhythm for days. Sasha also knows how to use her voice. She speaks her mind \u2014 if something\u2019s not right, you\u2019ll hear about it from her. Her style of direct, take-charge action is fueled by how deeply caring she is. She shows her heart in her own way (like fiercely defending her friends or pushing them to do their best). Personality Snapshot Bold, ambitious, a tad headstrong but incredibly loyal. She\u2019s the hype-woman and the drill sergeant rolled into one, with a heart of gold underneath. Sasha\u2019s Vibe \u201cStep up, stand tall, and make it loud \u2014 or step aside, \u2019cause Bunny Boo\u2019s coming through.\u201d (Mic drop, optional.) Style Sasha\u2019s style has two sides: urban sporty and super glam totally chic. She has a flair for streetwear: think camo pants paired with a sparkly crop top or a sleek tracksuit accessorized with blinged-out hoop earrings. She\u2019s often in cool sneakers or chunky boots that she can dance in. Sasha isn\u2019t afraid of color \u2014 she rocks bold oranges, reds, greens, but she often ties her look together with sharp black accents, denim, and gold. She\u2019ll mix a slouchy oversized jacket with a bodycon dress, effortlessly blending comfort and glam. Hair-wise, she experiments with braids, high ponytails, or a fro \u2014 always laid and slayed. Makeup Sasha\u2019s makeup usually features fierce colors and bold lashes, complementing her confident vibe. Likes Music is Sasha\u2019s first love \u2013 she\u2019s always curating playlists or learning the latest dance. (She\u2019s the one turning the volume up whenever a jam comes on).Pop culture Celeb gossip (somehow she knows everything about everyone) Being a trend hawk; she\u2019s up on the newest artists, the hottest brands, the latest slang. Organizing events (if the Bratz throw a party or talent show, Sasha\u2019s the de facto stage manager). TITLE: BRATZ CHARACTERS",

    "text": "Jade marches to the beat of her own drum machine. She\u2019s the experimental one \u2014 whether it\u2019s fashion, science, or a funky new hobby, Jade is always exploring. Often depicted as the trendsetter, she\u2019s basically a walking lookbook of next season\u2019s styles today. Fashionista Jade is upbeat and quirky; she\u2019s known to be a bit offbeat in the best way. She might show up with a daring new haircut out of nowhere or concoct a bizarre (but awesome) idea for a photoshoot. Jade is fearless in expressing herself and encourages others to do the same. She\u2019s also tech-savvy and smart \u2014 into things like coding or tinkering (yes, she can fix your computer and redesign your wardrobe). Of all the Bratz, Jade is most comfortable with change; she loves evolving and reinventing herself. But a constant is her commitment to her friends and her creative passion. Personality Snapshot Boldly creative, quirky, and always churning with ideas. She\u2019s the least conventional of the group and proud of it. Jade\u2019s Vibe \u201cBoring clothes make for a boring life \u2014 and I\u2019m not wasting time on that!\u201d Style In one word: extreme. Jade is a fashion daredevil \u2014 she\u2019ll try the wildest looks and somehow make them work. Her look mixes punk, goth, and couture in a blender and tops it with a dash of kawaii. She might pair a tartan punk skirt with a neon crop top and platform boots, then add a necktie belt just because. Layers, textures, and experimental silhouettes are her jam. One day she\u2019s in a sleek vinyl jacket, the next she\u2019s wearing a frilly Lolita-inspired dress over fishnet stockings. Her signature colors often include red, mustard, gunmetal, olive, bold blacks and whites with animal print and a touch of pink for a bit of irony. And accessories? She invents new ones. She might DIY a purse or customize her jacket with pins and patches. Makeup Jade\u2019s known to rock edgy makeup: maybe a bold colored streak in her hair (she isn\u2019t afraid to dye it funky colors), dramatic cat eyeliner, or experimental eyeshadow. Likes Fashion design (she\u2019s always sketching ideas or sewing up new outfits) Science & tech (fans know Jade has a secret nerdy side; she loves science class and might be found geeking out over a chemistry set or new gadget) Adrenaline hits (she\u2019s down to try things like amusement park rides, skydiving, etc. \u2013 she\u2019s adventurous!). Being lifestyle editor for the magazine, running the \u201ccouture and culture\u201d segment for all things trendy. TITLE: BRATZ FASHION FASHION RULEZ Fashion is a Bratz Core Value and a Narrative Pillar. Fashion isn\u2019t just clothing for us \u2014 it\u2019s character, story, and attitude all rolled into one. So how do we make sure that Bratz fashion always serves Bratz realness? These Fashion Rulez describe what shapes Bratz fashion and how we bring it so that our Bratz fashion always rules! HIGH FASHION X STREET FASHION FUSION NO FEAR, ALL FUN TRENDS SET, NOT FOLLOWED CHARACTER-CENTRIC WARDROBES FASHION FLEXIBILITY: EVOLVING STYLE High Fashion X Street Fashion Fusion From day one, Bratz pulled inspiration from the runways of Paris to the sidewalks of LA. We mix high fashion with underground street trends to create something fresh. Our designers ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s the coolest thing out there right now, and how do we push it further?\u201d  We love contrasts: glam vs. gritty, new vs. vintage, cute vs. edgy. This fusion gives Bratz its trendsetting edge. We\u2019re not copying what we see \u2013 we\u2019re remixing and elevating it. No Fear, All Fun The Bratz fashion philosophy? More expression, less inhibition. We don\u2019t believe in \u201ctoo much\u201d \u2014 as long as it\u2019s done with intention. Whether it\u2019s bold layering, clashing prints, or a daring silhouette, Bratz fashion is about experimentation, play, and personal flair. We don\u2019t play it safe, because our fans don\u2019t want safe \u2014 they want style that turns heads and feels like them. Trends Set, Not Followed We\u2019re early on trends (e.g., Bratz had streetwear-inspired looks before \u201cathleisure\u201d was even a word) or creating trends ourselves. Example? Our early 2000s oversized belts, wild chunky highlights, and platform shoes seemed extreme until a few years later when everyone was rocking that look. If mini bags are in, we make them micro mini. If neon is in, we do graffiti-covered neon. Always amp it up a notch. Character-Centric Wardrobes Each Bratz girl has a distinct point of view \u2014 that\u2019s by design. Yasmin\u2019s earthy boho glam, Cloe\u2019s sparkly sporty chic, Sasha\u2019s streetwear luxe, and Jade\u2019s punky experimental edge serve as unique frameworks that guide their styling across dolls, media, and merchandise. While their individual aesthetics stand on their own, they always look like a cohesive crew. A Bratz lineup should feel like a group you believe \u2014 different vibes, same energy. Fashion Flexibility: Evolving Style The Girlz\u2019 \u201cdefault\u201d fashion vibes are just the starting point. Like real trendsetters, the Bratz evolve and remix their looks to reflect new moments, moods, and eras. Whether it\u2019s red carpet glam, retro revival, fantasy fairies, or festival-core, their styles adapt while staying unmistakably them. CREATING LOOKS Bratz fashion is about innovation, self-expression, and a touch of rebellion. We draw inspiration from everywhere \u2014 youth culture, music videos, club scenes, vintage fashion archives, and our own Bratz history. Designers sketch freely and often, then we pick the loudest, proudest ideas to refine. And yes, we absolutely consider input from our fan community \u2014 they are often re-styling dolls and making fan art, which is an incredible inspiration pool. Bratz fashion thrives on that exchange of ideas: from the world to Bratz and back to the world. Fashion is our art form and our playground; every Bratz doll is a mini canvas to reflect that. While our mantra is often \u201cmore is more,\u201d we also know that restraint can be powerful. A well-placed detail, a refined silhouette, or a quiet contrast can hit just as hard. Whether it\u2019s loud or lowkey, the look should always feel intentional, expressive, and unmistakably Bratz. [Pop-Out] Mood boards for Bratz designs might have a pic of a pop star\u2019s edgy ensemble next to a Harajuku street snap, next to a 1970s glam rock costume. We encourage a very collage-like creative process. TITLE: BRAND VOICE ESSENTIALS BRATZ VOICE Our Bratz Voice Is: Sassy & Playful Empowering & Positive Unfiltered & Real Culturally Fluent Humorous but Heartfelt Sassy & Playful Bratz always has a little wink in her words. Our tone is full of attitude but never mean. We love to exaggerate for drama (\u201cliterally died when I saw those shoes \ud83d\ude0d\u201d), drop puns like accessories, and serve every line with a signature twist. Casual emoji use? Of course \u2014 we sprinkle them like glitter. And we don\u2019t simply borrow slang \u2014 we make our own. Bratz has always had its own dictionary. It\u2019s part of what makes us feel larger-than-life and it\u2019s a loveable piece of Bratz DNA that still quote. Empowering & Positive While we crack jokes and keep it light, the Bratz voice always uplifts. We cheer on our fans and our characters. Phrases like \u201cyou got this,\u201d \u201cgo for it!\u201d \u201cown it, girl\u201d appear often. Even when acknowledging challenges (\u201cNervous about that audition? Same, girl.\u201d), we pivot to encouragement (\u201cBut you know we\u2019re gonna rock it anyway\u201d). We're like a fitting room pep talk \u2014 honest but positive. Importantly, we promote self-compassion and acceptance: no self-deprecation beyond maybe a tiny comedic quip (\u201cI tripped in these platforms \u2014 klutz moment! \u2014 but hey, at least I did it fabulously\u201d). The Bratz voice builds confidence. Unfiltered & Real Bratz doesn\u2019t use corporate jargon or feel scripted. We write the way our fans talk to each other \u2014 casually, expressively, and a little chaotically in the best way. That means we sometimes start sentences with \u201cAnd\u201d or \u201cSo,\u201d we ask rhetorical questions (\u201cGuess what happened at the show last night?!\u201d), and we play with ALL CAPS or elongated vowels for drama (\u201cThat outfit is cuuuuute!\u201d). And we name real things \u2014 because we live in that world. But we don\u2019t try so hard to seem relatable that it gets cringey. Sure, we\u2019ll drop a \u201cslay,\u201d \u201cfab,\u201d or \u201cYas queen!\u201d now and then \u2014 but only if it feels authentic. Bratz speak Bratz \u2014 and that\u2019s already its own dialect \ud83d\udcaa. Culturally Fluent Bratz stays in the conversation \u2014 but we don\u2019t shout to be heard. Our voice is tapped into what\u2019s trending in fashion, music, internet culture, and design, but we use that fluency with intention and restraint. We\u2019ll reference a meme or a trending topic \u2014 but only when it feels true to the brand. We\u2019re never trying to go viral. We just live in the moment \u2014 and sometimes, the moment follows us. When it comes to deeper themes \u2014 like inclusivity, identity, or empowerment \u2014 we don\u2019t preach. We show it. Through our casting, our design choices, our storylines, and the way we move in the world, our fans know where we stand. It\u2019s baked into everything we do \u2014 no underlining needed. Humorous but Heartfelt Bratz uses humor as a glue, but we also aren\u2019t afraid to be sincere. We crack jokes in one sentence and then drop a genuine sentiment in the next. We balance the snark and sparkles with messages about friendship, loyalty, and self-confidence. Our voice never veers toward cynical or cold; we\u2019re always warm at the end of the day. That means no snarky takedowns or edgy-for-the-sake-of-it moments. Most importantly: we never punch down. We tease situations, not people. Our humor is cheeky, not catty and our heart eye emojis ring true . BRAND VOICE QUOTES BRAND VOICE QUOTES \u201cWe\u2019re the girls with a passion for fashion!\u201d \u2013 Bratz Motto \"Self-express in the way you dress\u201d \"If you got it, flaunt it!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t theorize, accessorize!\u201d \u201cWhatever you do, be totally you!\u201d CHARACTER QUOTES \u201cNo one can do you better than you!\u201d \u2014 Yasmin",
