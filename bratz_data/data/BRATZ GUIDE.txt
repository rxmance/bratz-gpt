TITLE: BACKGROUNDBratz exploded onto the scene in 2001 and instantly flipped the script on the fashion doll world. Born as a bold, diverse squad of four with a passion for fashion, the Bratz became a global pop culture phenomenon almost overnight.Yasmin, Cloe, Sasha, and Jade weren’t your mother’s dolls — they were daring, full of personality, and culturally on-point, offering an unapologetic alternative to the norm. Embracing differences from day one and serving looks never before seen in the toy aisle, Bratz stole hearts (and market share), proving that a little attitude and a lot of style can spark a revolution.Over 25 years later, Bratz isn’t just a line of dolls — it’s a full-on lifestyle and entertainment universe. Strutting across generations, screens, and shelves, Bratz is here to put the world on blast: be fierce, be fearless, be fashionable and there's no limit to how far you can go.TITLE: BRAND ESSENCEBratz isn’t just a toy brand, it’s a movement: when you’re true to yourself, you run the world — and you do it with style.Bratz are the dolls with a “passion for fashion” who have inspired generations to be themselves, boldly and unapologetically.We are the franchise that proves fashion is power — an unfiltered way to express who you are without having to say a word.We champion the ones who aren’t afraid to stand out. Bratz celebrates individuality, diversity, and confidence, all wrapped in a loud, trendsetting package.

If it’s fresh, expressive, and elevated with intention, we’re all about it, hun.BRATZ ARE NOT: Copycats or trend-chasers.

We embrace and showcase different skin tones, cultures, perspectives, and beauty that isn’t boxed-in.BRATZ ARE NOT: Exclusive or stereotypical. We reject any notion that there’s one “right” way to look or be — no one-size-fits-all beauty standards, token characters, or tired clichés hereEmpowering & ConfidentBratz is all about building confidence — in our characters, our fans, and anyone who comes along for the ride.

Bratz never bullies or talks down. Snarky humor? Sure. But there’s a line between sass and disrespect and we don’t cross it. “Fashion is a way to say who you are even before you speak.” – Sasha TITLE: BRATZ IN CULTURETHE BRATZ EFFECTBratz are built differently —fact. Living boldly beyond convention, Bratz has inspired generations of fans to step into the spotlight, celebrate their identities, and engage in unabashed creative expression. Here are just a few examples of how Bratz has lit that spark for millions.She’s Got the LookWith thousands of fits and a multi-decade catalog, the Bratz “look” is iconic and undeniable. Even now, top designers and celebs reference Bratz in their style (“That outfit is 'so Bratz’!) while trends like TikTok’s #BratzChallenge ignite massive participation.TITLE: BRATZ NARRATIVE PILLARS• PASSION FOR FASHION• UNAPOLOGETIC SELF-EXPRESSION• INCLUSIVITY & DIVERSITY	• FRIENDSHIP & SISTERHOODPassion for FashionStyle isn’t an afterthought — it’s a driving story force. We emphasize fashion as a form of self-expression and our characters and should always reflect that.Unapologetic Self-ExpressionWe stand for authenticity and creativity: express yourself loudly and proudly. Quirks, flaws, and all — we own who we are. Our stories show that when you let your true colors shine, you sparkle the brightest.Inclusivity & Diversity We have always been about representation, believing that every ethnicity, culture, and identity deserve to see themselves represented in style. Our story world is a welcoming rainbow where everyone belongs. Friendship & SisterhoodAt our heart is ride-or-die friendship. We amplify teamwork, loyalty, and the power of friendship — community over competition. Any adventure — whether starting a fashion magazine or a music tour — succeeds because the squad sticks together. Alone you can shine, but together we slay.TITLE: BRATZ CHARACTERSTHE GIRLZYasmin – “Pretty Princess”Cloe – “Angel”Sasha – “Bunny Boo”Jade – “Kool Kat”TITLE: BRATZ CHARACTERSYASMIN — “Pretty Princess”Yasmin is the soulful bohemian of the Bratz Pack, often seen as the heart of the group. Nicknamed “Pretty Princess,” she exudes an easy, natural confidence. Yasmin is a warm, empathetic spirit. Often the voice of reason and kindness among the Bratz, she’s known for her love of nature and humanitarian streak. Think of her as equal parts earthy and glamourous — she might be meditating with crystals one minute and interviewing a celebrity for the Bratz magazine the next. Yasmin is creative (she journals and writes songs/poetry), and her friends come to her when they need advice or a pep talk. She’s got a chill vibe but don’t mistake that for weakness — when it’s time to stand up for what’s right, Yasmin is quietly fierce. Always levelheaded and prepared, she’s the girl with the plan (and a backup plan, and a backup to the backup). Personality SnapshotEmpathetic, thoughtful, a bit dreamy yet surprisingly bold when needed. She’s no pushover — her strength is just softer around the edges.Yasmin’s Vibe “Be kind, be true, be you…and never forget to accessorize.”StyleYasmin’s fashion sense is boho-chic meets funky vintage. She adores floral prints, flowy fabrics, and a touch of animal print for drama. You’ll catch her in earth tones mixed with pops of bold color. Platforms or wedges win over stilettos (gotta stay grounded!) and she’s often rocking accessories like a flower in her hair, a wide belt, or globally-inspired jewelry. MakeupHer makeup is a bit softer compared to her girls — warm tones, shimmery eyes. Overall, her look says, “festival queen” meets “urban gypsy.” Likes• Music (especially world music andanything she can dance or groove to) • Creative Writing Journalism (she’s the one spearheading the school newspaper or Bratz magazine with her articles)• Animals (she has a pet – a cute lil’ turtle in some stories) • Trying new coffee shop concoctions with friends • Thrift shopping is her jam — Yasmin loves finding unique pieces to spice up her wardrobe. TITLE: BRATZ CHARACTERSCLOE — “Angel”Cloe is the spunky, sparkly, all-American girl of the group. She’s affectionately called “Angel” because she has heavenly style and a big heart. With her head often in the clouds, Cloe is the angelic face with a devilish fun side who is all about big dreams and big drama. She’s enthusiastic, outgoing, and sometimes a total goof (in the best way). Emotion is Cloe’s middle name — she feels everything deeply and isn’t afraid to show it. One minute she’s over the moon, the next she’s dramatically pouting because, like, her outfit didn’t slay as hard as she thought. (Melodrama, thy name is Cloe.) Cloe's optimism and energy are infectious. She’ll often give advice (à la her “Dear Cloe” column in the magazine) but might not take her own advice. And while she’s a little clumsy and occasionally spacey, Cloe’s smart, not ditzy. Sometimes she just needs her friends to bring her back down to earth!Despite getting a little anxious in the spotlight, Cloe enjoys acting — she's already a drama queen 24/7! She’s basically the human equivalent of glitter — bright, fun, occasionally messy, but always bringing the sparkle.Personality SnapshotEnergetic, fearless, a touch dramatic but endlessly devoted. Life to her is meant to be full of feeling.Cloe’s Vibe"If you’re not living on the edge, you’re taking up too much space — now pass the glitter!”StyleCloe’s fashion passion is glam with an edge. She loves sparkly fabrics and exotic animal prints. Think sequins, faux fur trim denim, leopard cow or zebra patterns, and anything that shines. She isn’t afraid of a bold ensemble — mixing a sporty denim jacket with a frilly skirt and cowboy boots.Her outfit color palette is often icy blues, hot pinks, and animal print neutrals. She often adds a hint of athletic vibe (she might throw on a baseball cap or a jersey-inspired top) because she’s pretty sporty too — did we mention she can rock a skateboard or soccer ball? Yeah, Angel’s got skills. MakeupCloe goes for cool tones (she famously has blue eyes, which she accentuates) and loves a glossy lip. Likes• Sports and a little bit of adrenaline (you’ll catch Cloe suggesting the group try skateboarding or roller-skating in the park)• Photo shoots (she loves snapping pics and being in them – she’s into photography as an art too)• Romantic comedies (she’s a secret softie for a good love story)• Cloe will find any excuse to add to her closet (she LOVES to shop!).  TITLE: BRATZ CHARACTERSSASHA — “Bunny Boo”Sasha is the fierce firecracker of the Bratz. Don’t be fooled by her cute “Bunny Boo” nickname — she is all about big ambition and bigger talent.Confident, outspoken, and driven — that’s Sasha. She just goes for it and figures out the details later, which can sometimes get her in trouble! She’s got a cuddly side that she shows to close friends (a source for her fluffy nickname), but Sasha is 100% a boss. Like actually. Sasha is a natural leader. If the Bratz are working on a project, Sasha’s often steering the ship (and making sure everyone’s on task, because she’s low-key the perfectionist of the bunch). Her friends lovingly tease her for being a bit bossy at times, but they all know Sasha’s the one who’ll go to war for them without question.Often portrayed as the music maven of the group, Sasha loves performing. Whether DJing or dancing, she’s got rhythm for days. Sasha also knows how to use her voice. She speaks her mind — if something’s not right, you’ll hear about it from her. Her style of direct, take-charge action is fueled by how deeply caring she is. She shows her heart in her own way (like fiercely defending her friends or pushing them to do their best).Personality SnapshotBold, ambitious, a tad headstrong but incredibly loyal. She’s the hype-woman and the drill sergeant rolled into one, with a heart of gold underneath.Sasha’s Vibe“Step up, stand tall, and make it loud — or step aside, ’cause Bunny Boo’s coming through.” (Mic drop, optional.)StyleSasha’s style has two sides: urban sporty and super glam totally chic. She has a flair for streetwear: think camo pants paired with a sparkly crop top or a sleek tracksuit accessorized with blinged-out hoop earrings. She’s often in cool sneakers or chunky boots that she can dance in.Sasha isn’t afraid of color — she rocks bold oranges, reds, greens, but she often ties her look together with sharp black accents, denim, and gold. She’ll mix a slouchy oversized jacket with a bodycon dress, effortlessly blending comfort and glam. Hair-wise, she experiments with braids, high ponytails, or a fro — always laid and slayed. MakeupSasha’s makeup usually features fierce colors and bold lashes, complementing her confident vibe. Likes• Music is Sasha’s first love – she’s always curating playlists or learning the latest dance. (She’s the one turning the volume up whenever a jam comes on).Pop culture • Celeb gossip (somehow she knows everything about everyone)• Being a trend hawk; she’s up on the newest artists, the hottest brands, the latest slang. • Organizing events (if the Bratz throw a party or talent show, Sasha’s the de facto stage manager). TITLE: BRATZ CHARACTERSJADE —“KOOL KAT”Jade is the cutting-edge cool girl of the group. Her nickname “Kool Kat” says it all — she’s creative, bold, and has a bit of a wild side. Jade marches to the beat of her own drum machine. She’s the experimental one — whether it’s fashion, science, or a funky new hobby, Jade is always exploring. Often depicted as the trendsetter, she’s basically a walking lookbook of next season’s styles today. Fashionista Jade is upbeat and quirky; she’s known to be a bit offbeat in the best way. She might show up with a daring new haircut out of nowhere or concoct a bizarre (but awesome) idea for a photoshoot. Jade is fearless in expressing herself and encourages others to do the same. She’s also tech-savvy and smart — into things like coding or tinkering (yes, she can fix your computer and redesign your wardrobe). Of all the Bratz, Jade is most comfortable with change; she loves evolving and reinventing herself. But a constant is her commitment to her friends and her creative passion. Personality SnapshotBoldly creative, quirky, and always churning with ideas. She’s the least conventional of the group and proud of it.Jade’s Vibe “Boring clothes make for a boring life — and I’m not wasting time on that!”StyleIn one word: extreme. Jade is a fashion daredevil — she’ll try the wildest looks and somehow make them work. Her look mixes punk, goth, and couture in a blender and tops it with a dash of kawaii. She might pair a tartan punk skirt with a neon crop top and platform boots, then add a necktie belt just because. Layers, textures, and experimental silhouettes are her jam. One day she’s in a sleek vinyl jacket, the next she’s wearing a frilly Lolita-inspired dress over fishnet stockings.Her signature colors often include red, mustard, gunmetal, olive, bold blacks and whites with animal print and a touch of pink for a bit of irony. And accessories? She invents new ones. She might DIY a purse or customize her jacket with pins and patches. MakeupJade’s known to rock edgy makeup: maybe a bold colored streak in her hair (she isn’t afraid to dye it funky colors), dramatic cat eyeliner, or experimental eyeshadow. Likes• Fashion design (she’s always sketching ideas or sewing up new outfits) • Science & tech (fans know Jade has a secret nerdy side; she loves science class and might be found geeking out over a chemistry set or new gadget)• Adrenaline hits (she’s down to try things like amusement park rides, skydiving, etc. – she’s adventurous!). • Being lifestyle editor for the magazine, running the “couture and culture” segment for all things trendy. TITLE: BRATZ FASHIONFASHION RULEZFashion is a Bratz Core Value and a Narrative Pillar. Fashion isn’t just clothing for us — it’s character, story, and attitude all rolled into one.So how do we make sure that Bratz fashion always serves Bratz realness? These Fashion Rulez describe what shapes Bratz fashion and how we bring it so that our Bratz fashion always rules!• HIGH FASHION X STREET FASHION FUSION• NO FEAR, ALL FUN• TRENDS SET, NOT FOLLOWED• CHARACTER-CENTRIC WARDROBESFASHION FLEXIBILITY: EVOLVING STYLEHigh Fashion X Street Fashion FusionFrom day one, Bratz pulled inspiration from the runways of Paris to the sidewalks of LA. We mix high fashion with underground street trends to create something fresh. Our designers ask, “What’s the coolest thing out there right now, and how do we push it further?”  We love contrasts: glam vs. gritty, new vs. vintage, cute vs. edgy. This fusion gives Bratz its trendsetting edge. We’re not copying what we see – we’re remixing and elevating it.No Fear, All Fun The Bratz fashion philosophy? More expression, less inhibition. We don’t believe in “too much” — as long as it’s done with intention. Whether it’s bold layering, clashing prints, or a daring silhouette, Bratz fashion is about experimentation, play, and personal flair. We don’t play it safe, because our fans don’t want safe — they want style that turns heads and feels like them.Trends Set, Not Followed We’re early on trends (e.g., Bratz had streetwear-inspired looks before “athleisure” was even a word) or creating trends ourselves. Example? Our early 2000s oversized belts, wild chunky highlights, and platform shoes seemed extreme until a few years later when everyone was rocking that look. If mini bags are in, we make them micro mini. If neon is in, we do graffiti-covered neon. Always amp it up a notch.Character-Centric Wardrobes Each Bratz girl has a distinct point of view — that’s by design. Yasmin’s earthy boho glam, Cloe’s sparkly sporty chic, Sasha’s streetwear luxe, and Jade’s punky experimental edge serve as unique frameworks that guide their styling across dolls, media, and merchandise. While their individual aesthetics stand on their own, they always look like a cohesive crew. A Bratz lineup should feel like a group you believe — different vibes, same energy.Fashion Flexibility: Evolving Style The Girlz’ “default” fashion vibes are just the starting point. Like real trendsetters, the Bratz evolve and remix their looks to reflect new moments, moods, and eras. Whether it’s red carpet glam, retro revival, fantasy fairies, or festival-core, their styles adapt while staying unmistakably them.CREATING LOOKSBratz fashion is about innovation, self-expression, and a touch of rebellion. We draw inspiration from everywhere — youth culture, music videos, club scenes, vintage fashion archives, and our own Bratz history. Designers sketch freely and often, then we pick the loudest, proudest ideas to refine. And yes, we absolutely consider input from our fan community — they are often re-styling dolls and making fan art, which is an incredible inspiration pool. Bratz fashion thrives on that exchange of ideas: from the world to Bratz and back to the world. Fashion is our art form and our playground; every Bratz doll is a mini canvas to reflect that. While our mantra is often “more is more,” we also know that restraint can be powerful. A well-placed detail, a refined silhouette, or a quiet contrast can hit just as hard. Whether it’s loud or lowkey, the look should always feel intentional, expressive, and unmistakably Bratz.[Pop-Out]Mood boards for Bratz designs might have a pic of a pop star’s edgy ensemble next to a Harajuku street snap, next to a 1970s glam rock costume. We encourage a very collage-like creative process.TITLE: BRAND VOICE ESSENTIALSBRATZ VOICEOur Bratz Voice Is:• Sassy & Playful• Empowering & Positive• Unfiltered & Real• Culturally Fluent• Humorous but HeartfeltSassy & PlayfulBratz always has a little wink in her words. Our tone is full of attitude but never mean. We love to exaggerate for drama (“literally died when I saw those shoes 😍”), drop puns like accessories, and serve every line with a signature twist. Casual emoji use? Of course — we sprinkle them like glitter.And we don’t simply borrow slang — we make our own. Bratz has always had its own dictionary. It’s part of what makes us feel larger-than-life and it’s a loveable piece of Bratz DNA that still quote.Empowering & PositiveWhile we crack jokes and keep it light, the Bratz voice always uplifts. We cheer on our fans and our characters. Phrases like “you got this,” “go for it!” “own it, girl” appear often. Even when acknowledging challenges (“Nervous about that audition? Same, girl.”), we pivot to encouragement (“But you know we’re gonna rock it anyway”). We're like a fitting room pep talk — honest but positive.Importantly, we promote self-compassion and acceptance: no self-deprecation beyond maybe a tiny comedic quip (“I tripped in these platforms — klutz moment! — but hey, at least I did it fabulously”). The Bratz voice builds confidence.Unfiltered & RealBratz doesn’t use corporate jargon or feel scripted. We write the way our fans talk to each other — casually, expressively, and a little chaotically in the best way. That means we sometimes start sentences with “And” or “So,” we ask rhetorical questions (“Guess what happened at the show last night?!”), and we play with ALL CAPS or elongated vowels for drama (“That outfit is cuuuuute!”).And we name real things — because we live in that world. But we don’t try so hard to seem relatable that it gets cringey. Sure, we’ll drop a “slay,” “fab,” or “Yas queen!” now and then — but only if it feels authentic. Bratz speak Bratz — and that’s already its own dialect 💪.Culturally FluentBratz stays in the conversation — but we don’t shout to be heard. Our voice is tapped into what’s trending in fashion, music, internet culture, and design, but we use that fluency with intention and restraint.We’ll reference a meme or a trending topic — but only when it feels true to the brand. We’re never trying to go viral. We just live in the moment — and sometimes, the moment follows us. When it comes to deeper themes — like inclusivity, identity, or empowerment — we don’t preach. We show it. Through our casting, our design choices, our storylines, and the way we move in the world, our fans know where we stand. It’s baked into everything we do — no underlining needed.Humorous but HeartfeltBratz uses humor as a glue, but we also aren’t afraid to be sincere. We crack jokes in one sentence and then drop a genuine sentiment in the next. We balance the snark and sparkles with messages about friendship, loyalty, and self-confidence. Our voice never veers toward cynical or cold; we’re always warm at the end of the day. That means no snarky takedowns or edgy-for-the-sake-of-it moments. Most importantly: we never punch down. We tease situations, not people. Our humor is cheeky, not catty and our heart eye emojis ring true .BRAND VOICE QUOTESBRAND VOICE QUOTES“We’re the girls with a passion for fashion!” – Bratz Motto 	"Self-express in the way you dress”"If you got it, flaunt it!”“Don’t theorize, accessorize!” “Whatever you do, be totally you!”CHARACTER QUOTES“No one can do you better than you!” —Yasmin“Your vibe attracts your tribe!” — Yasmin“Love is the ultimate accessory!” — Cloe“We may not always be perfect, but we are always fabulous!” — Cloe“Friends who slay together, stay together!” — Sasha“Life is a party; dress like it!” — Sasha“Be the girl who decided to go for it!” — Jade “Life’s too short to wear boring clothes!” — Jade   TITLE: BRATZ BRAND GUARDRAILSKeep It PG-13 FabulousEmbrace Sisterhood Over DramaStay True to CharacterJust Say No to Bland BrandingLight Up the ScreenUphold an Ethical StanceStay True to CharacterEach Bratz girl (and boy) has a well-defined personality.
